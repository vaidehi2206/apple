Sentry.io Integration

Overview
The website is linked with Sentry.io, a powerful tool for real-time error tracking and performance monitoring. This integration provides critical insights into application performance and user experience.

Technical Benefits of Sentry.io
Real-Time Error Tracking:
Automatically captures errors and exceptions in the application, providing developers with actionable insights.
Supports various programming languages and frameworks, ensuring broad compatibility.
Performance Monitoring:
Tracks key performance metrics such as response times, throughput, and error rates.
Identifies performance bottlenecks to enhance user experience.
User Feedback:
Collects user feedback on errors and performance issues, providing context for debugging.
Helps prioritize bug fixes based on user impact.
Integration with Popular Tools:
Seamlessly integrates with project management tools (e.g., Jira, Trello) for streamlined issue tracking.
Connects with version control systems (e.g., GitHub) to track errors against specific code changes.
Numerical Features
Error Rate Tracking: Displays the number of errors over a specified time frame, allowing developers to monitor trends.
Performance Metrics: Provides insights into average load times, with tracking for specific user interactions.
User Impact Analysis: Categorizes errors based on the number of users affected, prioritizing critical issues.

Conclusion

The project successfully implements a modern web development stack—React.js, Vite, and TailwindCSS—to build an interactive iPhone 15 Pro promotional website. The integration with Sentry.io enhances the development process by providing critical error tracking and performance monitoring features. The addition of GSAP animations adds dynamism, and further development is planned for advanced 3D rendering to enhance user interaction.

This comprehensive approach ensures that the website not only meets the aesthetic and functional demands of users but also maintains high performance and reliability throughout its lifecycle.
